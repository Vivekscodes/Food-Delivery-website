Okay, let's see. The user wants me to refactor this Node.js code using Mongoose. The original code is for connecting to a MongoDB database. First, I need to understand what the current code does. The connectDB function uses mongoose.connect with a connection string, and then logs a message when connected.

Hmm, the first thing I notice is that the connection string has the username and password in plain text. That's a security risk. The user should use environment variables instead. So I'll replace the hardcoded URL with a variable from process.env.MONGODB_URI. But wait, the original code doesn't have that. So I should add a note or comment suggesting that the URI should be in an environment variable.

Next, the function is declared as async but the mongoose.connect is inside a .then(). Since mongoose.connect returns a promise, using await directly would be cleaner. So maybe remove the .then() and just await the connect call. That way, the code is more straightforward and uses async/await properly.

Also, the original code exports connectDB as a default export. In the original code, it's written as export const connectDB = async () => { ... }, which is correct. But maybe adding a JSDoc comment would help with readability, explaining what the function does and any possible errors.

Error handling is missing. The current code doesn't catch any errors if the connection fails. Adding a try-catch block would make it more robust. So wrapping the await mongoose.connect in a try block and catching errors, then logging them or rethrowing.

Wait, the user said not to change the core logic. The original code doesn't have error handling, so adding that is an improvement without changing functionality. Because without it, errors would just be unhandled. So adding a try-catch is a good idea.

Also, the original code uses 'mongodb+srv' which is correct for Atlas, but maybe adding a comment about that. Or maybe not necessary. Let's focus on the code structure.

So putting it all together: the refactored function would use await without .then(), add error handling, use a variable for the URI (with a comment suggesting environment variables), add type hints if possible (though in JavaScript, that's not applicable, but maybe JSDoc types), and add comments explaining each part.

Wait, the original code is in JavaScript, but the user's example shows TypeScript? The code uses 'export const' which is ES6 modules. But the user is asking for type hints. Oh, maybe they want JSDoc comments for types. For example, adding @param and @returns.

But the original code is JS, not TS. So adding JSDoc for better readability. Also, the function is async, so it returns a Promise. So in the JSDoc, specify that.

Another thing: the original code's connection string has the database name 'FoodDel' at the end. Maybe that's correct, but no need to change that.

Putting it all together, the refactored code would look like:

- Use await mongoose.connect directly.
- Add try-catch for error handling.
- Use a variable for the URI with a comment.
- Add JSDoc comments.
- Add error logging.

So the final code would be something like:

export const connectDB = async () => {
    try {
        const uri = process.env.MONGODB_URI || 'mongodb+srv://...'; // default for dev, but should be in env
        await mongoose.connect(uri);
        console.log('Database Connected');
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Database connection failed', error);
        throw error;
    }
};

But the original code doesn't have the environment variable, so maybe the default is the original URI. But in practice, the user should set it in their .env file. So adding a comment to that effect.

Also, adding a JSDoc comment explaining the function.

So the final code includes all these changes. Let me write that out.

```javascript
import mongoose from "mongoose";

/**
 * Establishes a connection to the MongoDB database.
 * 
 * @returns {Promise<void>} A promise that resolves when the connection is successful.
 * @throws {Error} If the database connection fails.
 */
export const connectDB = async () => {
    try {
        // Use environment variable for production, default to local development URI
        const MONGODB_URI = process.env.MONGODB_URI || 'mongodb+srv://VivekSingh:51352895vs@cluster0.kv3gj.mongodb.net/FoodDel';
        
        await mongoose.connect(MONGODB_URI);
        console.log('✅ Database Connected');
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('❌ Database connection failed:', error.message);
        throw error;
    }
};
```
